It does not have the if statement. 

And it doesn’t really matter

I don’t want you understand why it doesn’t have the if statement, 
but I want you to understand that 
sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite 
it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case. 

And that’s good code. 

But this is simple code. 

This is CS 101. 

This is not important – although, details are important.
